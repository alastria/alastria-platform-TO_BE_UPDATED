# Welcome to the Alastria Platform wiki!
Alastria is the first multisectorial consortium promoted by organizations and institutions for the establishment of a Public-Permissioned Blockchain/DLT infrastructure, supporting services with legal effectiveness in the Spanish country scope and according with European regulation.

This site describes the technical details of the Alastria Platform, the blockchain infrastructure which is being built collaboratively by the entities associated in Alastria.

If you are not interested in the low-level technical details but would like to know more about the consortium, please go to the website: [Alastria National Blockchain Ecosystem](https://alastria.io/en.html).

# Using this wiki
There may be several reasons why you came here. Choose the one you are most interested in:

### You want to know how to develop and deploy Dapps on the Alastria Networks
In order to build the infrastructure, we have started with Quorum technology, an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum. From the point of view of the developer, Alastria Network Red-T is in general compatible with Dapps developed for Ethereum, but they can easily take advantage of the additional privacy mechanisms provided by Quorum.

Quorum is designed for applications requiring high speed and high throughput processing of private transactions within a permissioned group of known participants.

There is a Alastria Network (Red-T) composed of around 120 nodes from different entities (by mid 2020), which is stable since January 2019 to enable deployment and testing of Smart Contracts.

You can read more on the Alastria Networks and how to develop and deploy Dapps in Alastria here:
[Alastria Network Red-T for Dapp developers](en/Alastria-Testnet-for-Dapp-developers.md)

Also, you can deploy and test your solutions in the Alastria Network Red-B which is using Hyperledger Besu technology.

### You want to know what are the technical problems that Alastria is solving, how we are approaching them and what are the challenges for a network like Alastria
Being a country-wide blockchain network with the ambition to be as public as possible, Alastria is neither a public-permissionless network nor a private consortium (sometimes just referred to as permissioned network). Alastria shares some of the properties of both types of networks, but it has some requirements of its own.

You can find a more detailed description of the Alastria Platform, its requirements and challenges for the future here: [Alastria Core Technical Platform](en/Alastria-Core-Technical-Platform.md)

### You want to collaborate in building the infrastructure that powers Alastria and allows running Dapps
For Dapp developers, the Core Platform APIs and the deployment mechanisms are already stable and they are not expected to change.

However, in order to achieve the ambitious objectives of Alastria, there is a lot of work ahead on the Core Platform, mainly with operational mechanisms that will make the Alastria network a resilient infrastructure which is production-ready for a mainnet.

Without entering into details, these are the main lines where we are working, and we would welcome any help from the members of Alastria:
* Test and make more robust the networks, by installing additional Regular nodes and developing and deploying Dapps on it. We all need to perform many more tests to ensure that the network complies with the high standards that we require along the years.
* Improve and simplify the processes for installation and configuration of nodes. The objective is that they be as automatic as possible and that they support the major deployment infrastructures available on the market, wether cloud providers or on-premises. This is an ongoing process.
* Improve the monitoring systems, and specially the Decentralized Network Administration tools, which will allow the implementation of a true Decentralized Governance Model of the Alastria network, required in a Public-Permissioned blockchain network. They are also critical components which will enable us to comply with the objectives and policies defined in the Resiliency Commission of Alastria.
